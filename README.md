# TikTok fictional workplace scenario
I'm taking the Google Advanced Data Analytics. Learners who complete the seven courses in this program will have the skills needed to apply for data science and advanced data analytics jobs. This certificate assumes prior knowledge of foundational analytical principles, skills, and tools covered in the Google Data Analytics Certificate. <p>
And it offers a choice of different fictional workplace scenarios to use when completing each end-of-course project, I 've chosen the Tik Tok one which is created in partnership with this plaftform of short video hosting.The certificate consists in 7 courses, and in the course 1 we had to build a project proposal, I will update this repository as I take the courses! 

## Course 1 Foundations of Data Science
I chose the tiktok scenario because I found the project very catchy, which aims to develop a machine learning model that helps classify claims in the videos submitted to the platform. Also I chose this option because I love TikTok so much, since I perceive the huge effect this platform has in the way the world connects and create new relationships, I also see it as a place where the creativity and freedom of expression are suported.

### So the main tasks are listed here:
- Assign PACE stages to the requested tasks for the classification project.
- Organize tasks into milestones.
- Create a project proposal for the team.

Note: The project proposal can be seen in the files upload as [Activity_Template_Project Proposal](https://github.com/anxta/TikTok-workplace-scenario/blob/main/Activity%20Template_%20Project%20Proposal.pdf)
