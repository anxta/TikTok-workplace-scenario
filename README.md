# TikTok fictional workplace scenario
I'm taking the Google Advanced Data Analytics, this certificate offers a choice of different workplace scenarios to use when completing each end-of-course project, I 've chosen the Tik Tok one which is created in partnership with this plaftform of short video hosting.
The certificate consists in 7 courses, and in the course 1 we had to build a project proposal, I will update this repository as I take the courses! 

## Course 1 Foundations of Data Science
I chose the tiktok scenario because I found the project very catchy, which aims to develop a machine learning model that helps classify claims in the videos submitted to the platform. Also I chose this option because I love TikTok so much, since I perceive the huge effect which this platform has in the way the world connects and create new relationships, I also see it as a place where the creativity and freedom of expression are suported.

### So the main tasks are listed here:
- Assign PACE stages to the requested tasks for the classification project.
- Organize tasks into milestones.
- Create a project proposal for the team.

Note: The project proposal can be seen in the files upload as [Activity_Template_Project_Proposal](https://github.com/anxta/TikTok-workplace-scenario/blob/main/Activity%20Template_%20Project%20Proposal.pdf)
